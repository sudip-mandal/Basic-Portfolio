Create a fully responsive single-page portfolio website using HTML,
 CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). The theme should be dark and creative, 
with a modern and professional look. It must include scroll-based animations, 
animated elements, and motion effects that feel smooth and interactive.

Use my existing content from the HTML file (name, bio, skills, projects,
contact info, etc.). Use unique Google Fonts or other fitting font styles 
that match the creative dark aesthetic.

**Sections to include:**
- Hero section with name, tagline, and a strong call-to-action (e.g., "Hire Me", "Download Resume")
- About Me section with bio
- Skills section (tech stack with icons or styled layout)
- Projects section (3â€“6 projects with description, tech used, GitHub and live demo links)
- Experience / Certifications section
- Contact section (email form or direct links)
- Sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling and active section highlighting

**Styling and effects:**
- Dark theme with a matching accent color (you choose what fits best)
- Smooth scroll behavior for nav links
- Scroll-triggered animations using AOS.js or your own CSS animation system
- Creative design with moving elements (e.g., floating shapes, subtle parallax, or glowing effects)
- Fully mobile-responsive layout

Optimize code for performance and responsiveness. Keep file structure clean and modular (use external CSS and JS). Suggest improvements if needed.

After structure is done, help me with:
- Animations
- Color palette
- Font selection (using Google Fonts or others)
- SEO meta tags and performance optimizations
